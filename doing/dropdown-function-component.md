# I have a function component in phoenix that can create dropdown menus

It could be the user_menu which only has two links or it could be the Connections dropdown which will contain the latest 10 connection and is constantly being updated.

So in this case, would a possible context be Shared...??

... the simplest function component was erroring when I use attr in the file

* I had put the file in the /drifter directory's first level

MIND I want to create a Connection schema and a connections table anyways...
* [ ] so follow along the function component section and instead of creating a Survey context create a Circles context

Circles stand for networks and the term comes directly from Stephen Covey's "Cirle of Influence"... and "Circle of Concern"... I think
