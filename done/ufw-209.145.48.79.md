After obtaining the opened TCP and UDP ports on your server, you need to decide which ports should be allowed to accept inbound connections. If there’s an openSSH server running, then you should always allow TCP port 22 before activating UFW. This is achieved via the following command.

sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
or

sudo ufw allow ssh
You probably want to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic, so run the following command to allow inbound connection on TCP port 80 and 443.

sudo ufw allow 80/tcp

sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
If you run an email server, you need to allow TCP port 25 (SMTP), 587(submission), 143(imap) and 993 (imaps).

sudo ufw allow 25/tcp

sudo ufw allow 587/tcp

sudo ufw allow 143/tcp

sudo ufw allow 993/tcp
If you want your user to be able to use POP3 protocol, you need to allow TCP port 110 (POP3) and 995 (POP3S).

sudo ufw allow 110/tcp

sudo ufw allow 995/tcp
If you run a BIND DNS server, then you need to open TCP and UDP port 53.

sudo ufw allow 53
The above command will allow both the TCP and UDP port. If you want to allow the UDP port only, then

sudo ufw allow 53/udp
Opening Multiple Ports at Once
You can allow multiple ports like below.

sudo ufw allow 80,443,25,587,465,143,993/tcp

Enabling UFW
After you have set allowed ports in UFW, you need to enable UFW. But before doing that, it’s recommended to enable logging with the following command so that you can better understand if your firewall is working correctly.

sudo ufw logging on
The default log level is ‘low’. The log file is /var/log/ufw.log. I usually use the “medium” log level.

sudo ufw logging medium
Now enable UFW.

sudo ufw enable
Note: If you have previously used iptables firewall directly, those iptables firewall rules will be undone once UFW is enabled.
Check status

sudo ufw status
To show more information, run

sudo ufw status verbose
