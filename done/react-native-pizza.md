* [x] update xcode
Even though I just upgraded to 13.4.1 yesterday, Ventura requires xcode 14.  It looks like there are some ways to use 13 but I'm already halfway through installing 14... So just wait for 14 to finish installed and come back here later...
vvvv It's on 14.XXX now

* [x] development setup per this REF https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

* [x] back up all stuff on this computer to hard disk
