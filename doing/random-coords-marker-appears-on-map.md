vvvv marker stays in the same place WHEN I maplibre-gl.css manually inside the static/assets/app.css file

* [x] put the maplibre-gl.css file in assets/css directory
* [x] import maplibre-gl.css into the app.js file

---> css for maplibre is still not included in app.css after mix phx.server WHEN I import it in the app.js

So now I just want Phoenix to put the maplibre-gl.css file into app.css WHEN I compile the app, which I guess is WHAT I'm doing WHEN I mix phx.server... restart the server

??WHERE is esbuild being called inside of drifter_live main directory?
