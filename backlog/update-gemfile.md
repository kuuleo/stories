As a Drifter, I have a clean Gemfile for drifter_api that give me no crap when I do a rails routes or a rails s or a rails c.

WHEN I do a bundle outdated, this is my outbput:

... I don't remember but rails routes is working now again.

* [ ] updated devise-jwt to 0.10.0
* [x] updated puma to 6.0.0
